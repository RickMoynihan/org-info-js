* Bugs

** TODO Bug when sections use h1 headlines (??)

   Script will not start properly, when sections use h1 headline.

   Please test. Could be solved by code cleanup on[[ 2008-03-11 Di ]].

** TODO History Bug: less than 50 entries?

   It seems. Not realy shure.

** TODO [/]Fixed TOC and =i=

   '=i=' focusses the first link in T.O.C. if =FIXED\_TOC= is
   set.
   + [ ] Unfortunately it still (or again?) scrolls the window for some
         reason.
   + [ ] The tab-indexes are wrong: they traverse the first-level links, then
         the second level links and so on.


* TODOs

** TODO Clean and restructure -> View-plugins

   Restructure the code, such that view is separated from the documents
   structure- and access-functionality of =org_html_manager=.

   How about a packaging mechanism like mootools, jQuery and the others?
   Just create a org-info-core.js from org-info.js in a first step that just contains

** TODO Interlink tag-index and TOC.

   A feature request of Rick Moynihan.

** TODO Use arrow keys

   A feature request of Rick Moynihan. Navigate using Arrow keys.

** TODO Enhance presentations

   There are lots of suggestens, mostly provided by Rick Moynihan.

   + Use properties to support step by step dipslay of list items. Not shure
     how this could be done (are properties exported?). Maybe use tags instead?

** TODO Create a separate script for presentations

   ... and utilize jQuery for efects (I prefer jQuery for it's performance,
   GPL, usability and documentation). For those interested:

   + [[http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page]] - Homepage
   + http://jquery.com/test/ - test browser-compatibility.
   + http://remysharp.com/visual-jquery/ - better and faster docs.

** TODO Text before first Headline

   Text before first headline will show up on all pages above the navigation
   (not visible in info view though since we scroll the window to the
   navigation bar when in info view mode). Some will like that, most will say
   what I say: it's a bug. Pardon me.

   The best solution for this IMHO would be:

   1) [X] Turn the index into a /normal/ =OrgNode=.
   2) [ ] Put the /text before first headline/ into an =OrgNode= too.
   3) [ ] Display /text before firste headline/ as the first page in '/info view
      mode/' and append the TOC at the end of the document.

** TODO Assign Style Classes to navigational Elements

   The navigational elements used should have distinct style class names so
   their appearance can be customized by the user. Currently they have no style
   classes but hard coded properties.

** TODO Customizable Text for '/HOME/' and '/Up/'

** TODO Save Cookie

   Optionally safe the documents state to a cookie. This would empower visitors
   to store the state of an XHMTL file so they could come back the next day and
   read on.

** TODO  Move the Footnots into own =<div>=

   Footnotes are in the last container element. This is syntactically wrong,
   since Footnotes for all Sections go into the last parargraps container.

   It's a bug in org IMHO.

** TODO Create Testfiles for all Combinations of relevant Options

   A nice thing to have. We need tests for the different settings of export
   options concerning scripts like this one usable for other scripts too. Here
   is a list of options in question and theire shorthands in the =#+OPTIONS:=
   line. Some of them are not tested at all:

   | Shorthand | What it does                                           |
   |-----------+--------------------------------------------------------|
   | H:        | Level of headslines                                    |
   | toc:      | T.O.C.                                                 |
   | @:        | Turn on HTML-Tags (think of headlines containing HTML) |
   | f:        | Footnotes                                              |
   | skip:     | Text before first headline                             |
   | tags:     | Tags in headlines/toc                                  |
   | d:        | Drawers. Candidates for folding.                       |

   Text before first headline is currently displayed on each and every page in
   info view mode. Footnotes are not tested at all. HTML-Tags should be no
   problem.

** TODO =d:= exports Drawers.

   This could be reflected by the script. Always hide drawers, but open them on
   click.
